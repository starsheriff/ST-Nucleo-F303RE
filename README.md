# Nucleo F303RE Projects

Many thanks to [Patryk Jaworski](http://regalis.com.pl/en/arm-cortex-stm32-gnulinux), 
he published a very nice tutorial explaining how to use the STM Nucleo boards under Linux.
The basic project template follows his instructions quite closely and I will repeat a lot from his blog.
