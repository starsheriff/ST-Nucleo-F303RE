# Flashy Baremetal
Same as `flashy`, only with custom baremetal startup and linker scripts. There is no call to `SystemInit` required either.

For documentation of `main.c` see the [documentation of `flashy`](https://github.com/starsheriff/ST-Nucleo-F303RE/tree/master/flashy)


# Makefile
Most of the time I actually spent on the makefile.
